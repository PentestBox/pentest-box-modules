Restaring Tab as Admin
--------------------------

By default PentestBox runs like an normal user, no administratore permission is required to launch it.  But when you will be operating it then some tools might need administrative permission. In that case you need to right click on tab and choose restart as admin , after this that tab will be given administrative rights.

PentestBox KeyBoard Shortcuts
------------------------------------

* CTRL + T : To open new tab
* CTRL + C : To close the script/program running.
* If opened multiple Tabs then you can access them using "SHIFT+ ALT +number" , number is the value for the tab . For example, number will be 1 for first tab and 2 for second tab and so on.
* CTRL + w : This will close your current active console.
* ALT +Enter : Pentestbox will go FullScreen.

Update Feature
---------------------------------

Maintaining a product is always much more important than actually making one. That is why to keep all the tools updated inside PentestBox we have included a update utility. Also i have added update config which will be used as a medium to fix the bugs if any comes up and update tools to include a new tool in coming future through our github repo. 
You would see something similar if you would type update on console.

It will first update itself from it's Github Repository if there are any changes and then display the menu. In case there is no Internet Connection, script will wait for some time and then display the menu.

For example if you need to update your **WebAplications Tools** then just type **update webapplication**, you can update all the tools in one command by typing **update all**.

Tools Manager
-----------------------------------

Tools Manager was introduced in PentestBox v2.0. Using this utility you can install/update/Uninstall tools which are not there in PentestBox. This makes PentestBox more modular.

It is an interactive Installation utility, type **toolsmanager** on terminal to open it. First it will update itself from Github Repository and then will display the menu. In case there is no Internet Connection, script will wait for some time and then display the menu.

You can see list of tools by selecting particular category. For example, if i choose **Web Applications** Category and press **10**, it will display something like this. At the time of writing, it only has **whatweb**.

Now if you want to install **whatweb**, then type **install whatweb** and it will install whatweb. After installing it will display alias for the tool, like in the case of whatweb it is **whatweb**.

Map PentestBox folder as Network Drive
--------------------------------------------

Consider a environment where you want to use PentestBox on many computers like office, lab, etc. Instead of installing PentestBox on each and every computer, you can just install that on one computer and share that folder as a drive to other computers on the same network.

* First Right Click on PentestBox folder which is located in C drive and select properties.
